### UC-04 Navigation skipping dates without notes

#### Precondition
Ensure there is a note for one day in the past, two empty notes after it, not counting the current day (with the current day, there will be three empty notes).

#### Functionality mechanics
To conveniently "jump" over a series of empty notes, a button appears on the screen to go to the nearest existing note. The button appears only if there are two or more empty notes in a row. That is, when an empty note is open and there is another empty note after it. If there are several empty notes in the past/future, but there is no existing note after them, the jump is made to the oldest/newest note, even if they are empty.
#### Test Case
