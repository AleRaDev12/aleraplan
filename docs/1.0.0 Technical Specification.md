## 🧱 Architecture

### Feature-Sliced Design

|Layer|Description|
|---|---|
|`app/`|Initialization of Zustand, QueryClient, theme providers, routing|
|`processes/`|Initialization of notes and date state|
|`pages/`|`DiaryPage`: screen for viewing and editing a note|
|`widgets/`|Navigation components, save status, "go to note" button|
|`features/`|`note-navigation`, `note-editing`, `note-saving`, `note-jump`|
|`entities/`|`note`: note model, types, repository interfaces|
|`shared/`|`ui/`, `lib/date`, `lib/storage`, `config/i18n`|

---

## 📦 Note Management

### Repository Interface `noteRepository`

```ts
interface NoteRepository {
  getNote(date: string): Promise<Note | null>;
  setNote(date: string, text: string): Promise<void>;
  getNotesRange(start: string, end: string): Promise<Record<string, Note>>;
  getExistingNoteDates(): Promise<string[]>; // list of dates with entries
}
```

- Storage: AsyncStorage
- Key: `note:YYYY-MM-DD`
- Value: `{ text: string, updatedAt: string }`

TanStack Query will be wrapped in the `useNoteQuery(date)` hook and cache notes for 5–10 min. Cleanup policy — standard QueryCache strategy (LRU).

## 📋 UI and UX

### Main Screen (DiaryPage)

- Shows the note for the selected date
    
- Header — current date (localized format)
    
- Multiline note view
    
- Double tap or button press — switch to edit mode
    
- Limit: 10,000 characters
    
- Autosave:
    
    - every 5 seconds after change
        
    - on minimize/close
        

### Navigation

- Swipes left/right to switch between days
    
- Cannot go to the future
    
- "Go to note" button appears if ≥2 empty days in a row
    

### Save Status Component

- Shows:
    
    - "✓ Saved"
        
    - "⚠ Not saved"
        
    - ⏳ "Saving..." (while sending)
        
- Does not block editing
    

---

## 🔒 Restrictions

- Only one note per date
    
- No future dates
    
- No server sync (local storage only)
    
- No PIN/Face ID
    

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Coverage: UC-01...UC-04 (as in test cases)
    
- Check:
    
    - autosave and restore
        
    - correct swipe operation
        
    - input limit
        
    - correct "go to note" behavior
        
- Visual tests on main devices (iOS/Android)

## 📍Next Steps

Ready to suggest the following steps:

### 1. **Project framework setup**

- `expo init`
    
- connect Gluestack, Zustand, Query
    
- set up FSD structure
    

### 2. **Implement note model and noteRepository**

- AsyncStorage with interface and mock data
    

### 3. **DiaryPage with basic UI**

- date header
    
- note text
    
- swipes
    

### 4. **Edit mode and autosave**

- TextArea
    
- debounce, save indicator
    

### 5. **"Go to note" button**

- calculate nearest filled date
    
- jump to it
